Kaggle PetFinder Competition: ~~Deep Learning~~ Machine Learning For Puppies

Abstract:

PetFinder.my has been Malaysia’s leading animal welfare platform since 2008, building in the meantime a rich database of more than 150,000 animals, completed with their history and photos. Recently it held a competition on Kaggle, requiring participants to develop algorithms to predict the adoptability of pets - specifically, how quickly a pet is going to be adopted. The problem mixed tabular data, textual information and varied images, requiring finding an optimal mix of preprocessing and learning techniques in order to achieve a performing result. Our team, comprising 3 Kaggle masters and 3 Kaggle experts from 3 three different countries, achieved the 8th rank in the competition and thereafter open-sourced our solution. In the talk, we illustrate the organizational and technical challenges (with their solutions) we had to face in order to achieve such a result.
